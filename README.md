# Handwriting-digit-recognition-
Handwritten digit recognition is a Deep Learning project whereyou will take  hand-drawn images of the numbers 0-9 and build and train a neural network to recognize and  predict the correct label for the digit displayed using tensorflow and the MNIST dataset. 
We use logistic regression model to train the dataset.
and finally create a GUI to output our results and accuracy.
